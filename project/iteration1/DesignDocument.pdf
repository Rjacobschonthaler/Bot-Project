	This program is a game that simulates a robot moving around an arena while interacting with other objects in the arena. The goal of the game is to maneuver the robot to the home base before the robot's battery runs out.
	The robot is controlled by a user whom operates the robot by the arrow keys on the keyboard to turn the robot left and right as well as speed up and slow down. The left, right, up, and down arrow keys change the robot with respect to the order in the previous sentence. The robot contains a battery and a sensor. The battery drains as the robot runs and losses charge if the robot hits a wall or an obstacle. The battery also ends the game if it runs out. The sensor is used to tell when the robot hits a wall or an obstacle and adjusts the heading of the robot if there is a collision. 
	Obstacles in the arena include general obstacles, a recharge station, and a home base. General obstacles are stationary and cause a loss of charge if the robot runs into them. The recharge station is a stationary obstacle which gives the robot a full charge upon the robot colliding with it. The home base is the only other mobile object in the arena and ends the if the robots collides with it.
