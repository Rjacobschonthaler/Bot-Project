 *
 *
 * This program is to simulate robots moving around in an arena interacting with obstacles and the boundaries of the arena. The robots are
 * controlled by the user. The robots can be recharged by colliding with the recharge_station obstacle. The robots goal is to collide with the
 * home_base obstacle. The robot will slowly lose energy as the simulator runs and lose energy when it collides with an obstacle not including the
 * home_base or recharge_station.
