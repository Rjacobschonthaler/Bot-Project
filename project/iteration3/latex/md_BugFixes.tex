This document lists all the current bugs that are known in my program.

Bug 1\+: This bug happens when the robot\textquotesingle{}s speed is 1 or 2. When the robot is moving, one must press the turning arrow keys twice in the direction they want to go before the robot changes it\textquotesingle{}s heading. The total change in heading is equal to 2 presses of the turning key.

Bug 2\+: This bug happens when the speed set for the robot when it runs into an obstacle or wall is 1 or 2. When one runs their robot into an obstacle or wall, the robot may freeze and not move until the operator presses the forward key. The robot will then move in the correct direction away from the obstacle or wall. The robot tends to do this more so when it hits the bottom right quadrant of an obstacle.

Bug 3\+: This bug happens on a very rare ocasion(maybe 1\%). The homebase has been seen to not bounce off the right wall and keep moving out of the arena. It has only done it after, the random number generaotr from the reset button has angled it towards the right wall, and it hits the wall without any change in heading.
